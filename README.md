Earthquake Map Visualization

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) provides vital data on natural hazards, ecosystems, and climate change. They gather extensive earthquake data globally but need better visualization tools. This project aims to develop a tool to visualize USGS earthquake data, helping educate the public and support government efforts, potentially leading to more funding.

Features :

Map Initialization: Centers the map on Dubai (Middle East) with a zoom level of 3.

Base Layers: Includes street view and topographic layers using OpenStreetMap.

Earthquake Data: Fetches and displays recent earthquake data from the USGS in a LayerGroup.

Color Coding: Colors circles based on earthquake depth.

Size Scaling: Sizes circles based on earthquake magnitude.

Popups: Displays details such as place, time, magnitude, and depth for each earthquake.

Legend: Shows a color gradient representing different depth ranges on the map.
